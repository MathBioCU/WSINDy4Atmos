- See [the tutorials and examples located here](https://github.com/SethMinor/PyWSINDy-for-PDEs) for instructions on how to use the codebase.
- To recreate results in the paper, see `wsindy_for_weather_examples.ipynb` and `full_globe_wsindy.py` (uses older code).

**Note:** unfortunately, our examples data files are too large host on GitHub.
Luckily, they are all publicly-available! Interested readers are directed towards the following locations:
